One of the big problem for anybody interested in China and data science is the
availability of data sets. There are limited free resources available and they
are often incomplete or inaccurate. Getting data and especially cleaning data
becomes one of the biggest pain of data science applied to China.

The objective of this group of post is to illustrate the problem and associated
process on a specific example: plot a map of the airports of mainland China.

In this third part, we will do some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
of the OurAirports data set we obtained in
[part 1](https://datapleth.io/blog/2015/12/29/2015-12-29_china_airports_part_1/) and 
[part 2](https://datapleth.io/blog/2015/12/30/2015-12-30_china_airports_part_2/)

## OurAirports data : exploratory data analysis

### Overview

This dataset looks more complete than the Openflight data, there are more field
and more lines (`r nrow(airportChinaOurairports)` airports). Let's follow 
similar process for exploration / cleaning.There are some field of little interest for us which are removed.

```{r clearFieldOA}
str(airportChinaOurairports)
```


### Variable `type.airport`
```{r checkOA51}
unique(airportChinaOurairports$type.airport)
```

Let's keep for the moment heliport, seaplane_base and closed airports on top of 
all other categories. We have still `r nrow(airportChinaOurairports)` references.


### Variable `name`  
```{r checkOA6}
# initialise per default all airports as civil airports
airportChinaOurairports$category <- "civil airport"
# Find airport which name contains air base
test <- airportChinaOurairports[grepl(pattern = "AIR BASE", x = toupper(airportChinaOurairports$name)),]
knitr::kable(head(dplyr::select(test, name, IATA.FAA, ICAO))) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c(
      "striped"
      , "hover"
      , "condensed"
      , "responsive"
      )
    ) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
# categorise these airports as military
airportChinaOurairports[grepl(pattern = "AIR BASE", x = toupper(airportChinaOurairports$name)),]$category <- "military airport"
```

Checking the names by `unique(airportChinaOurairports$name)` we find out that 
some of the names are probably military airports, called Air Base, there are
`r nrow(test)`. We categorized them as military. In China some of the military
airport have a civil use, let's keep them all for the moment.

### Variable `latitude.deg`, `longitude.deg`, `elevation.m`
```{r checkAO2}
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$latitude.deg)) +
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$longitude.deg))
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$elevation.m))
```
We only have missing values elevation. But do we have 0? Does the data looks
logical ? Let's build a plot of the distributions of these variables.

```{r checkAO3}
##      Create the 2x2 tiled chart to be filled by row
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
hist(airportChinaOurairports$latitude.deg, breaks = 20)
hist(airportChinaOurairports$longitude.deg, breaks = 20)
hist(airportChinaOurairports$elevation.m, breaks = 20)
hist(airportChinaOurairports[airportChinaOurairports$elevation.m < 50,]$elevation.m, breaks = 100, xlab = "Airports with elevation < 50m")
```

With this tiled chart we can visualize quickly that distribution of latitude and
longitude which looks reasonable with no extreme values. Regarding elevation, we
have a lot of airport in low elevation and in the bottom right chart we see that
almost none of them are at 0 meters.


```{r mapAO, warning=FALSE}
g <- ggplot() + theme_bw()
## airports with elevation
g <- g + geom_point(
    data = airportChinaOurairports,
    aes(
        x = longitude.deg, y = latitude.deg,
        colour = elevation.m, shape = type.airport
        ),
    pch = 19)
## airport with 0 m  as elevation in red
g + geom_point(
    data = airportChinaOurairports[is.na(airportChinaOurairports$elevation.m),],
    aes(x = longitude.deg, y = latitude.deg, colour = elevation.m),
    size = 5, alpha = 0.2, col = "firebrick", pch = 1
    ) + ggtitle("exploratory plot of OA dataset with elevation")
```

This map is the plot of airports based on the geolocalisation and elevation. 
Airports with NA data for elevation are highlighted by a red circle. 

### Variable : `city`
```{r checkOAcity}
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$city))
sum(airportChinaOurairports$city == "")
airportChinaOurairports[airportChinaOurairports$city == "",]$city <- NA
```
Some empty values, no NAs for city, but several empty string char, we replace
thees by NA.

### Variable `scheduled.service`
```{r checkOAscheduled.service}
unique(airportChinaOurairports$scheduled.service)
```
No empty char or NA for scheduled.service field.


### Variable `IATA.FAA`
Let's check the airport which are not matching a 3 letters pattern, what's their
code ? As seen bellow, in fact the data is missing, let's substitute by NAs.
Rename this field with same title as in Openflight dataset.

```{r checkOA3}
unique(airportChinaOurairports[!grepl( pattern = "[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]",x = airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA),]$IATA.FAA)
airportChinaOurairports[!grepl( pattern = "[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]",x = airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA),]$IATA.FAA <- NA

```

**Is IATA unique ?***
```{r OAIATAunique}
checkIATA <- as.data.frame(table(airportChinaOurairports[!is.na(airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA),]$IATA.FAA))
names(checkIATA) <- c("IATA.FAA", "freq")
doublon <- checkIATA[checkIATA$freq > 1,]$IATA.FAA
airportChinaOurairports[!is.na(airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA) & airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA == doublon[1],c(2,6,7)]
airportChinaOurairports <- airportChinaOurairports[!grepl(pattern = "Duplicate", airportChinaOurairports$name),]
```

We can delete the duplicate records

### Variable `ICAO`
Let's check it as we did for Openflight data. Replace blank values by NA.

```{r checkOA5}
unique(airportChinaOurairports[!grepl( pattern = "[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]",x = airportChinaOurairports$ICAO),]$ICAO)
airportChinaOurairports[!grepl( pattern = "[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]",x = airportChinaOurairports$ICAO),]$ICAO <- NA
```

**Is ICAO unique ?**, seems yes ! No more duplicates are found  
```{r ICAOTAunique}
checkICAO <- as.data.frame(table(airportChinaOurairports[!is.na(airportChinaOurairports$ICAO),]$ICAO))
names(checkICAO) <- c("ICAO", "freq")
checkICAO[checkICAO$freq > 1,]$ICAO
```

### Variable `airport.home.link`
```{r checkOAairport.home.link}
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$airport.home.link))
sum(airportChinaOurairports$airport.home.link == "")

airportChinaOurairports <- dplyr::select(airportChinaOurairports, -airport.home.link)
```
Most of the data is empty, let's scrap this field.s

### Variable `airport.wikipedia.link`  
```{r checkOAairport.wikipedia.link}
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$airport.wikipedia.link))
sum(airportChinaOurairports$airport.wikipedia.link == "")
airportChinaOurairports[airportChinaOurairports$airport.wikipedia.link == "",]$airport.wikipedia.link <- NA
```
The data is partly empty, let's replace empty strings by NA.

### Variable `region.name`  
```{r checkOAregion.name}
sum(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$region.name)) + 
sum(airportChinaOurairports$region.name == "")
sum(airportChinaOurairports$region.name == "(unassigned)")
airportChinaOurairports[airportChinaOurairports$region.name == "(unassigned)",]$region.name <- NA
unique(airportChinaOurairports$region.name)
```
We replace the unassigned region name by NA.


### Removing military airports

The military airports to be removed are the one with no ICAO and IATA.FAA codes.
We assume they don't provide passenger service.

```{r noCodeOA}
## Airports with no IATA & ICAO and of type military
airportChinaOurairports <- airportChinaOurairports[!(is.na(airportChinaOurairports$ICAO) & is.na(airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA) &   airportChinaOurairports$category == "military airport"),]
```

### Conclusion
We have a dataset of `r nrow(airportChinaOurairports)` airports which still 
requires some work to complete the missing data for few IATA codes and several
ICAO Codes. Most of the elevation data is missing.

Let's use the Amelia package to get an overview of the missing data in the data
set.

```{r ourAirportAmelia, message=FALSE}
library(Amelia)
missmap(airportChinaOurairports, main = "Missingness Map of OurAirports Chinese airport Dataset")
```


```{r noCodeOA2, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Airports with IATA but no ICAO
test <- airportChinaOurairports[is.na(airportChinaOurairports$ICAO) & !is.na(airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA),]
dplyr::select(test, name, city, IATA.FAA)
```

```{r noCodeOA3, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Airports with IATA and no ICAO
test <- airportChinaOurairports[is.na(airportChinaOurairports$ICAO) & is.na(airportChinaOurairports$IATA.FAA),]
dplyr::select(test, name, city)
```

## Saving objects for next part
Let's now save the different objects to be reused in the next part in which we
will be creating one data set and fetching missing data.

```{r saveObjects, cache=FALSE}
save( list = c("airportChinaOpenflights", 
               "airportChinaOurairports"
               ),
      file = "./data/chinese-airports-part-3.Rda")
```
